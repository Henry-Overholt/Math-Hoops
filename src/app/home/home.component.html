    <h1>Welcome to Math Hoops <em>the Computer Game!</em></h1>
    <p>
      Math Hoops is a fast-paced math game, designed to teach students
      probability, as well as quick decisions. They will practice their quick
      mental math skills with single digit, adding, subtract, multiplying, and
      division. Players use real life statistics of their favorite WNBA and NBA
      players, to see if they can beat the computer!
